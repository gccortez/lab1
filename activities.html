There are a lot of applications used nowadays, my favorite apps are Twitter, Facebook
messenger and Spotify. I started using twitter since 2014 and that is the app that I used to express how I
feel through tweeting. Twitter used to become my friend back in the days since this is the app that I
used a lot and I spent time with. I read about other people’s thoughts and opinions about stuff. What I
also like about twitter is the community since they don’t really care, and they don’t judge you for what
you tweet about. The features of twitter are it has night mode, it can darken the whole application if the
user turns on the dark mode feature, also, the use of twitter is to express your thoughts through tweet.
So, most likely, if you are using twitter, you will read a lot. Next, Facebook messenger, I used this a lot
since this is often the tool that we use to communicate with our families, friends and loved ones. I like
this app since it can communicate through chatting, voice calling and video calling. There are other
features of this app like you can play mini games if you get bored or if you are waiting for a reply. Also,
Facebook messenger has night mode which people can use if the interface is too bright or if the user
does not want the white design. Lastly, Spotify. This is also my favorite since I love listening to music. It
really helped me a lot to boost my energy when I listen to music. Spotify really helped me to boost my
energy since most of the songs nowadays are streamed in Spotify. This is a music application so the
feature of this app if that you can play songs anytime and anywhere.
