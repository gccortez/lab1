  Hello! 

  Gian is an 18-year old computer science student at Asia Pacific 
  College. He lives at Villamor Air Base, Pasay City. He has 2 
  siblings and he is the middle child. He is a joyful person. Although 
  he is not so friendly, but he is nice and caring . He used to love 
  playing computer games, but he stopped because he wants to focus more on 
  his studies.


  During summer, Gian spends his free time reading the bible and playing piano. 
  He has a bad habit of studying at school, last minute before a test. He 
  procrastinates most of the time and crams his school works, yet he still 
  manages to get good grades. Heâ€™s not usually confident about his academic 
  performance, regardless he still aims for progression and not perfection.

  
  What makes Gian interesting? 


  Well, he resembles Grizz of We Bare Bears.


  What Gian is expecting from this subject (USERDES) is that he will 
  learn more about designing an interface of an application since it 
  needed this for an easier interaction between the user and the program. 
  He is also expecting that they will learn and have fun at the same time.
